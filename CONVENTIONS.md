# Project Conventions

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Preact with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **External Libraries**: @xenova/transformers (loaded via CDN)

## Key Conventions

1. Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
2. Utilize Preact for building UI components.
3. Load heavy libraries like @xenova/transformers via CDN to improve initial load times.

## Best Practices

- Write self-documenting code and add comments where necessary.
- Keep components and functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Utilize TypeScript features for improved code quality and developer experience.
- Regularly run tests and address any issues that arise.
- Review and update dependencies as needed, ensuring compatibility and security.
- When using CDN-loaded libraries, specify the version to ensure consistency across environments.
